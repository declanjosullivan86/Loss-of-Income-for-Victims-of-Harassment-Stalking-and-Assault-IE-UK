    <h1>Legal Frameworks and Remedies: Loss of Income for Victims of Harassment, Stalking, and Assault (Ireland & UK)</h1>

    <div class="meta-info">
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 2025<br>
        <strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> Ireland & United Kingdom<br>
        <strong>Subject:</strong> Compensation for Loss of Income, Civil/Criminal Remedies, and Third-Party Liability (Enablers/Financiers)</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Criminal Injuries Compensation Schemes</h2>

    <h3>Ireland: Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal (CICT)</h3>
    <p>The Irish scheme compensates victims for personal injuries from violent crimes, including out-of-pocket expenses and loss of earnings.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Governing Document:</strong> <em>Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted</em> (General Scheme).</li>
        <li><strong>Application Timeline:</strong> Applications must be submitted within <strong>3 months</strong> of the incident. Late applications (up to 2 years) are accepted only in exceptional circumstances.<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup></li>
        <li><strong>Loss of Earnings Coverage:</strong> Compensation is provided for loss of earnings (past and future) directly resulting from the injury. This requires vouched expenses and documentary evidence (e.g., P60s, tax returns).</li>
        <li><strong>Compensation Basis:</strong> Awards are assessed on the basis of damages under the <em>Civil Liability Act 1961</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>EU Directive & Case Law:</strong> The Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) ruled in <em>Case C-129/19</em> regarding the EU Directive 2004/80/EC, mandating that member states must provide fair and appropriate compensation, which has pressured the State to ensure schemes cover material and non-material damages.<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup></li>
        <li><strong>Recent Statistics:</strong> In 2024, significant variances in awards were noted, with high-end awards reaching approx. €238,894 (inclusive of €236,250 for past loss of earnings) for severe cases.<sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>UK: Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA)</h3>
    <p>The CICA scheme handles claims for England, Scotland, and Wales.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Governing Legislation:</strong> <em>Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2012</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>The 28-Week Rule:</strong> Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is the primary vehicle for the first 28 weeks. CICA loss of earnings payments are only payable from <strong>week 29</strong> onwards.<sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup></li>
        <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> The injury must result in a total inability to undertake paid work or a very limited capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Cap on Damages:</strong> The maximum payout for a single award (including loss of earnings and special expenses) is capped at <strong>£500,000</strong>.<sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup></li>
        <li><strong>Application Timeline:</strong> Claims must generally be made within <strong>2 years</strong> of the incident.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Civil Actions for Damages</h2>

    <h3>Ireland</h3>
    <p>Battery and assault are torts actionable <em>per se</em> (without proof of loss), but harassment requires proof of damage.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>New Stalking Laws (2024):</strong> Under Part 5 of the <em>Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2023</em>, victims can apply to the District Court for civil restraint orders. This includes emergency orders lasting up to 8 days.<sup><a href="#ref5">[5]</a></sup></li>
        <li><strong>Harassment Offense:</strong> Section 10 of the <em>Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997</em> (as amended) covers persistent conduct. The standalone stalking offense now carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.</li>
        <li><strong>Damages Categories:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><em>General Damages:</em> Pain and suffering.</li>
                <li><em>Special Damages:</em> Pecuniary losses including <strong>loss of earnings</strong>, medical costs, and property damage.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>UK: Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (PHA)</h3>
    <p>The PHA 1997 creates both criminal offenses and a statutory tort for harassment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Civil Remedies (Section 3):</strong> Victims may claim damages for anxiety and financial loss.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust [2006]</em> confirmed that employers can be vicariously liable for harassment committed by employees.<sup><a href="#ref6">[6]</a></sup></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Key Requirements:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Conduct must occur on at least two occasions.</li>
                <li>Must be calculated to cause alarm or distress.</li>
                <li><em>Jones v Ruth [2011]</em> established that damages can be awarded for anxiety even without a recognized psychiatric injury.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Limitation Period:</strong> Six years from the date of the harassment (Section 2, <em>Limitation Act 1980</em>).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Legal Action Against Enablers and Financiers</h2>

    <h3>Joint Tortfeasors and Conspiracy</h3>
    <p>To recover lost income from financiers or those who "enabled" the stalker/attacker, the claimant must prove <strong>Joint Tortfeasorship</strong>.</p>

    <h4>Common Design & Joint Liability</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Principle:</strong> Liability arises where parties act in furtherance of a common design.</li>
        <li><strong>UK Case Law:</strong> <em>Fish & Fish Ltd v Sea Shepherd UK [2015] UKSC 10</em>. The Supreme Court held that to be liable as a joint tortfeasor, the defendant must have given "substantial assistance" to the primary tortfeasor pursuant to a common design.<sup><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup></li>
        <li><strong>Conspiracy:</strong> Requires:
            <ol>
                <li>Combination/Agreement.</li>
                <li>Unlawful means.</li>
                <li>Intention to injure.</li>
                <li>Resulting damage (loss of income).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Ireland-Specific Principles</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Civil Liability Act 1961 (Section 11):</strong> Defines "concurrent wrongdoers."</li>
        <li><strong>Conspiracy:</strong> Irish courts view a combination to use unlawful means as a civil wrong regardless of motive, whereas the UK often looks for the <em>predominant intention</em> to damage the claimant (unless unlawful means were used, in which case intention to injure is sufficient).<sup><a href="#ref8">[8]</a></sup></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Obstruction of Justice (Civil Implications)</h3>
    <p>While "Obstruction" is primarily criminal:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ireland:</strong> <em>Criminal Justice Act 1999</em> (Section 41) – Intimidation of witnesses/potential witnesses.</li>
        <li><strong>Civil Utility:</strong> Evidence of funding legal defense to prolong harassment, or funding flight risks, can be used as evidence of <strong>"Unlawful Means Conspiracy"</strong> or to prove the "Common Design" element in a joint tort claim.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Summary of Actionable Steps</h2>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Action</th>
                <th>Ireland (Time Limit)</th>
                <th>UK (Time Limit)</th>

                <td>Enablers/Financiers</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Key Recommendations</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Concurrent Filings:</strong> Pursue State compensation immediately (due to short deadlines) while building the civil case.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence of "Common Design":</strong> To sue a financier, you must document that they did not just provide money, but did so <em>knowing</em> it would facilitate the harassment or effectively "commissioned" the acts.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Counsel:</strong> Retain solicitors specializing in <em>intentional torts</em> and <em>asset tracing</em> to handle claims against financiers.</li>
