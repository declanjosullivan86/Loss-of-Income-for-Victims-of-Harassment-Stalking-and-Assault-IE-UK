## 1. Criminal Injuries Compensation Schemes

### Ireland: Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal (CICT)
The Irish scheme compensates victims for personal injuries from violent crimes, including out-of-pocket expenses and loss of earnings.

* **Governing Document:** *Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted* (General Scheme).
* **Application Timeline:** Applications must be submitted within **3 months** of the incident. Late applications (up to 2 years) are accepted only in exceptional circumstances [^1].
* **Loss of Earnings Coverage:** Compensation is provided for loss of earnings (past and future) directly resulting from the injury. This requires vouched expenses and documentary evidence (e.g., P60s, tax returns).
* **Compensation Basis:** Awards are assessed on the basis of damages under the *Civil Liability Act 1961*.
* **EU Directive & Case Law:** The Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) ruled in *Case C-129/19* regarding the EU Directive 2004/80/EC, mandating that member states must provide fair and appropriate compensation, which has pressured the State to ensure schemes cover material and non-material damages [^2].
* **Recent Statistics:** In 2024, significant variances in awards were noted, with high-end awards reaching approx. €238,894 (inclusive of €236,250 for past loss of earnings) for severe cases [^3].

### UK: Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA)
The CICA scheme handles claims for England, Scotland, and Wales.

* **Governing Legislation:** *Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2012*.
* **The 28-Week Rule:** Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is the primary vehicle for the first 28 weeks. CICA loss of earnings payments are only payable from **week 29** onwards [^4].
* **Eligibility:** The injury must result in a total inability to undertake paid work or a very limited capacity.
* **Cap on Damages:** The maximum payout for a single award (including loss of earnings and special expenses) is capped at **£500,000** [^4].
* **Application Timeline:** Claims must generally be made within **2 years** of the incident.

## 2. Civil Actions for Damages

### Ireland
Battery and assault are torts actionable *per se* (without proof of loss), but harassment requires proof of damage.

* **New Stalking Laws (2024):** Under Part 5 of the *Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2023*, victims can apply to the District Court for civil restraint orders. This includes emergency orders lasting up to 8 days [^5].
* **Harassment Offense:** Section 10 of the *Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997* (as amended) covers persistent conduct. The standalone stalking offense now carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.
* **Damages Categories:**
    * *General Damages:* Pain and suffering.
    * *Special Damages:* Pecuniary losses including **loss of earnings**, medical costs, and property damage.

### UK: Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (PHA)
The PHA 1997 creates both criminal offenses and a statutory tort for harassment.

* **Civil Remedies (Section 3):** Victims may claim damages for anxiety and financial loss.
    * *Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust [2006]* confirmed that employers can be vicariously liable for harassment committed by employees [^6].
* **Key Requirements:**
    * Conduct must occur on at least two occasions.
    * Must be calculated to cause alarm or distress.
    * *Jones v Ruth [2011]* established that damages can be awarded for anxiety even without a recognized psychiatric injury.
* **Limitation Period:** Six years from the date of the harassment (Section 2, *Limitation Act 1980*).

## 3. Legal Action Against Enablers and Financiers

### Joint Tortfeasors and Conspiracy
To recover lost income from financiers or those who "enabled" the stalker/attacker, the claimant must prove **Joint Tortfeasorship**.

**Common Design & Joint Liability**
* **Principle:** Liability arises where parties act in furtherance of a common design.
* **UK Case Law:** *Fish & Fish Ltd v Sea Shepherd UK [2015] UKSC 10*. The Supreme Court held that to be liable as a joint tortfeasor, the defendant must have given "substantial assistance" to the primary tortfeasor pursuant to a common design [^7].
* **Conspiracy:** Requires:
    1.  Combination/Agreement.
    2.  Unlawful means.
    3.  Intention to injure.
    4.  Resulting damage (loss of income).

**Ireland-Specific Principles**
* **Civil Liability Act 1961 (Section 11):** Defines "concurrent wrongdoers."
* **Conspiracy:** Irish courts view a combination to use unlawful means as a civil wrong regardless of motive, whereas the UK often looks for the *predominant intention* to damage the claimant (unless unlawful means were used, in which case intention to injure is sufficient) [^8].

### Obstruction of Justice (Civil Implications)
While "Obstruction" is primarily criminal:
* **Ireland:** *Criminal Justice Act 1999* (Section 41) – Intimidation of witnesses/potential witnesses.
* **Civil Utility:** Evidence of funding legal defense to prolong harassment, or funding flight risks, can be used as evidence of **"Unlawful Means Conspiracy"** or to prove the "Common Design" element in a joint tort claim.

## 4. Summary of Actionable Steps

| Action | Ireland (Time Limit) | UK (Time Limit) | Primary Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **State Compensation** | 3 Months (Strict) | 2 Years | CICT (IE) / CICA (UK) |
| **Civil Harassment** | 6 Years | 6 Years | Perpetrator |
| **Personal Injury** | 2 Years | 3 Years | Perpetrator |
| **Joint Tort/Conspiracy** | 6 Years | 6 Years | Enablers/Financiers |

### Key Recommendations
1.  **Concurrent Filings:** Pursue State compensation immediately (due to short deadlines) while building the civil case.
2.  **Evidence of "Common Design":** To sue a financier, you must document that they did not just provide money, but did so *knowing* it would facilitate the harassment or effectively "commissioned" the acts.
3.  **Legal Counsel:** Retain solicitors specializing in *intentional torts* and *asset tracing* to handle claims against financiers.
